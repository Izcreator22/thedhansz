    <h3>Wikipedia has a lofty goal: a comprehensive collection of all of the knowledge in the world. Wikipedia's purpose is to benefit readers by acting as a widely accessible and free encyclopedia; a comprehensive written compendium that contains information on all branches of knowledge.</h3>

    <br><br>The name was suggested by Sanger on 11 January 2001 as a portmanteau of the words wiki (Hawaiian for "quick") and encyclopedia. The wikipedia.com and wikipedia.org domain names were registered on 12 and 13 January, respectively, with wikipedia.org being brought online on the same day.
    <br><br>Wikipedia is a free, open content online encyclopedia created through the collaborative effort of a community of users known as Wikipedians. Anyone registered on the site can create an article for publication; registration is not required to edit articles.
    <br><br>Unlike other top websites, Wikipedia is not funded through advertising, nor does it rely on selling data about users for profit. Instead, Wikipedia is supported by its readers - people who find value in Wikipedia and want to continue to support its success, with the average donation being about $15 USD.
    <br><br>In April 2023, close to 4.5 billion unique global visitors had visited Wikipedia.org, slightly down from 4.9 billion visitors in January. Wikipedia is a free online encyclopedia with articles generated by volunteers worldwide. The platform is hosted by the Wikimedia Foundation.
