        <h2>Who is Santa Claus?</h2>
        <p>Santa Claus, also known as Saint Nicholas, Kris Kringle, Father Christmas, or simply Santa, is a legendary figure originating in Western Christian culture who is said to bring gifts on Christmas Eve. He is generally depicted as a portly, joyous, white-bearded man, often with spectacles, wearing a red suit with white fur trim and a red hat with a white pompom.</p>
        <p>Santa Claus is said to make lists of children throughout the world, categorizing them according to their behavior, and delivering presents, including toys and candy, to well-behaved children on Christmas Eve. He is often assisted by elves who help him manage his workshop at the North Pole.</p>
